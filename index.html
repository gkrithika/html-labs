          from the State Capital Chennai. It was the capital of Pandiyas and has a history of over 2000 years. A legend
          says Vedasarma a strong devotee of Lord Siva had sown the paddy and went to the river. There was heavy rain in
          the area, in spite of the downpour, the paddy did not submerge in the water. Hence this place was called as
          “Tiru-nel-veli” (Divinely protected paddy). On acquisition from the Nawab in 1801, the British named this area
          as Tinnevelly. Popular Kanthimathi-Nellaiyappar temple, dedicated to Siva and Parvathy is located here. 1000
          pillar hall with musical pillars and beautiful sculptures are special architectural features of this temple.
          Krishnapuram Temple located 13 kms from the town, is dedicated to Lord Vishnu called as Thiruvenkatanathar.

      <div class="main-text">Kanthimathi – Nellaiappar Temple: This is one of the Five Celestial Dance Sabhas
        [Divine Dance Stages] of Lord Siva. This temple is called as Thamara Sabhai [ Copper]. Chidambaram [Pon / Gold
        Ambalam] , Madurai [Velli / Silver Ambalam], Tiruvalankadu [Rathinam / Ruby] and Kutralam [Chitiram / Murals]
        are the other Four Sabhas of Lord Siva. Most popular and famous twin temple of Kanthimathi Nellaiyappar
        dedicated to Goddess Parvathi [called as Kanthimathi] and Lord Siva[called as Nellaiyappar] is located in an
        area of 14 acres. It is one of the biggest of its kind in Tamil Nadu in the heart of the Tirunelveli Town , on
        the banks of Tamiraparani River.

        The Musical Pillars in the Mani Mandapam which produces sound in various pitches when struck, was the creation
        of Nindrasir Nedumaran [Koon Pandian] in the 7th Century. The Somavara Mandapam, the 1000 pillared hall, and the
        Tamira Sabha with excellent wood work, are the most attractive and exotic structures of this huge Temple
        Complex.

        In the Earlier Years, the Nellaiappar and Kanthimathi temples were two independent structures with space in
        between. It was the great efforts of Vadamalaiyappa Pillaiyan who connected both the temples by building a
        structure called ‘Sangili Mandapam’ or called as Chain Mandapam in English, in the year 1647. A Vasantha
        Mandapam with 100 pillars, in the midst of a Flower Garden to the west of the Sangili Mandapam was the
        contribution of Thiruvenkadakrishna Mudaliar in the year 1756.

        Within the temple complex, near the sanctum sanctorum , there is a shrine dedicated to Lord Vishnu (Nellai
        Govindan) in the reclining posture. It is believed that, Lord Vishnu descended down to this holy place to
        solemnize the celestial Wedding of Lord Siva and Parvathi. Nataraja and Sivakami , A shrine to Sandhana
        Sabhapati (adorned with sandal paste) behind the Thaamira Sabha, and another shrine to Nataraja called as the
        Periya Sabhapati are the other important deities of the temple. It is a grand spectacle to view Sandhana
        Sapapathi through Thamara Sabhai. Festivals are conducted on special occasion like Arudhra Darshan [Dec-Jan] to
        these deities. Vasantha Navarathri, Tirukalyanam, Saradha Navrathri, Ani [Aug-Sept] Brahmotsavam are the
        important festivals of this temple.</div>
