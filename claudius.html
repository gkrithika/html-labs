<h1>Claudius</h1>

   <P> Claudius (full name Tiberius Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus) was the grandson of Mark Antony, brother of
    Germanicus, and the uncle of Caligula. He was descended from both the Julian and the Claudian clans, as was
    Caligula. He was about 50 years old at the time of Caligula's murder. He never held public office until late in his
    life, mainly due to his family's concerns as to his health and mental abilities. Suetonius has much to say about
    Claudius' apparent disabilities, and how the imperial family viewed them, in the "Life of Augustus".

    The assassination of Caligula caused great terror in the palace and, according to Suetonius, Claudius, being
    frightened by the sounds of soldiers scouring the palace for further victims, hid behind some curtains on a balcony
    nearby. He was convinced that he would be murdered as well because he was within direct family of Caligula, the last
    emperor. A soldier checking the room noticed feet sticking out from underneath the curtains, and upon pulling back
    the curtains discovered a terrified Claudius. He acclaimed Claudius the new emperor and took him to the rest of the
    soldiers, where they carried him out of the palace on a litter. Claudius was taken to the Praetorian camp, where he
    was quickly proclaimed emperor by the troops.

    We learn from Suetonius that Claudius was the first Roman commander to invade Britain since Julius Caesar a century
    earlier. Cassius Dio gives a more detailed account of this. He also went farther than Caesar, and made Britain
    subject to Roman rule. Caesar had "conquered" Britain, but left the Britons alone to rule themselves. Claudius was
    not as kind. The invasion of Britain was the major military campaign under his reign.

    According to Suetonius, Claudius suffered from ill health all of his life until he became emperor, when his health
    suddenly became excellent. Nonetheless, Claudius suffered from a variety of maladies, including fits and epileptic
    seizures, a funny limp, as well as several personal habits like a bad stutter and excessive drooling when
    overexcited. Suetonius found much delectation in recounting how the pitiable Claudius was ridiculed in his imperial
    home due to these ailments. In his account of Caligula, Suetonius also includes several letters written by Augustus
    to his wife, Livia, expressing concern for the imperial family's reputation should Claudius be seen with them in
    public. Suetonius goes on to accuse Claudius of cruelty and stupidity, assigning some of the blame to his wives and
    freedmen.

    Suetonius discusses several omens that foretold the assassination of Claudius. He mentions a comet that several
    Romans had seen shortly before the assassination. As mentioned earlier, comets were believed to foretell the deaths
    of significant people. Per Suetonius, Claudius, under suggestions from his wife Messalina, tried to shift this
    deadly fate from himself to others by various fictions, resulting in the execution of several Roman citizens,
    including some senators and aristocrats.

    Suetonius paints Claudius as a ridiculous figure, belittling many of his acts and attributing his good works to the
    influence of others. Thus the portrait of Claudius as the weak fool, controlled by those he supposedly ruled, was
    preserved for the ages. Claudiusâ€™ dining habits figure in the biography, notably his immoderate love of food and
    drink, and his affection for the city taverns.

    His personal and moral failings aside however, most modern historians agree that Claudius generally ruled well. They
    cite his military success in Britannia as well as his extensive public works. His reign came to an end when he was
    murdered by eating from a dish of poisoned mushrooms, probably supplied by his last wife Agrippina in an attempt to
    have her own son from a previous marriage, the future emperor Nero, ascend the throne.
