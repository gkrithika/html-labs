    <h1>Reliability</h1>
    <p>The book can be described as racy, packed with gossip, drama, and sometimes humour. At times the author
        subjectively expresses his opinion and knowledge.[citation needed].Although he was never a senator himself, Suetonius took the side of the Senate in most conflicts with the
        princeps, as well as the senators' views of the emperor. That resulted in biases, both conscious and
        unconscious. Suetonius lost access to the official archives shortly after beginning his work. He was forced to
        rely on secondhand accounts when it came to Claudius (with the exception of the letters of Augustus, which had
        been gathered earlier) and does not quote the emperor.[citation needed]

        The book still provides valuable information on the heritage, personal habits, physical appearance, lives, and
        political careers of the first Roman emperors. It mentions details which other sources do not. For example,
        Suetonius is the main source on the lives of Caligula, his uncle Claudius, and the heritage of Vespasian (the
        relevant sections of the Annals by his contemporary Tacitus having been lost). Suetonius made a reference in
        this work to "Chrestus", which could refer to Christ. During the book on Nero, Suetonius does mention Christians
        (see Historicity of Jesus). As with many of his contemporaries, Suetonius took omens seriously and carefully
        includes reports of omens portending imperial births, accessions, and deaths.
